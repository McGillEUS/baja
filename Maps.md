# How I made the maps for comps

I used this site to create a map using a custom dark theme to match the site: https://snazzymaps.com/build-a-map/edit/403854  

To format the image I did this:  
1. When editing size and location, use a width of 480 px and a height of 520 px (The final image will be a square but the text at the bottom should be chopped off)
2. In center location, enter the name of the location
5. Edit the latitude coordinate by adding 3.25 (this will move it lower so the text on the site has more space)
3. Use zoom level 5
4. For the marker, search for the location again
6. I used the color #E91B2F and size 36px (could be anything)
7. I used Paint.net for the next part to make it the right size, but could use anything
8. Take a screenshot around the map (can be rough, make sure windows app zoom is set to 100% otherwise image may be a different size)
9. In Paint.net, use the magic wand to select the outside of the screenshot
10. Invert the selection, then crop to selection
11. Adjust canvas size to 480 by 480 (should just remove bottom 40 px)
